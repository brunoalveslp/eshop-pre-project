## It's project is currently in development
This project represents a significant milestone in my college journey, as it serves as a prototype for my term paper. At its core, it's a dynamic e-commerce application meticulously crafted using cutting-edge technologies.

**Front-End:** 
The front-end of the application is constructed using Angular, a powerful framework, and enhanced with the versatility of RxJs for reactive programming. We've also leveraged NgBootstrap for intuitive and responsive UI components. To ensure a polished and stylish appearance, we've implemented Sass, a preprocessor scripting language.

**Back-End:**
On the back-end, we've harnessed the robust capabilities of the .NET ecosystem. Specifically, we've employed .NET with C# and Asp.Net Core to build a secure and high-performance foundation. Entity Framework empowers us with seamless data access and management. Furthermore, we've strategically incorporated various other .NET features to optimize functionality. 

**Database:**
Our database strategy is twofold. For cart management and quick data retrieval, we've integrated Redis as a cache database. During development, we rely on Sqlite as a versatile and lightweight database solution, while Postgres takes the reins in production for its scalability and reliability.

**Architecture and Design Patterns:**
The architectural design follows the Clean Architecture paradigm, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. Additionally, we've employed established design patterns such as the Repository Pattern and Specification Pattern to enhance code organization and promote code reusability.

This project encapsulates the synergy of modern web development technologies and best practices, offering a glimpse into the exciting world of e-commerce app development within the .NET and Angular ecosystems.
